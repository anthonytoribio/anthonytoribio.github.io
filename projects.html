                <p>As a team, we created an Andorid app that let's the user create a Youtube Playlist that
                    synced to their Youtube account. They can delete existing playlists, add videos to playists,
                    delete videos from playlists. Users also have the option to auto-create playlist based on
                    the keyword they enter. The app was created using Andoid Studio and Kotlin. We utilized several views,
                    like Recycler views, and created our own HTTP handler to handle API calls to the Youtube 
                    Data 3.0 API.

                    Javascript, and Django.
